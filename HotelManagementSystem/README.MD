Develop a hotel management application for an imaginary hotel in C# language. The application should allow storing and searching information of the hotel and its rooms and customers from files using binary reader and writer. Define necessary classes for handling hotel, room and customer data. The main attributes of the hotel class are name, construction date, address, the number of stars and dynamic lists for rooms and customers. The hotel class should contain methods for saving its own data as well as the data of  its rooms and customers to files in binary mode. The main attributes of the room class are room number, area, type (single, double, etc.), price per night and description. The main attributes of class customer are name, address, room number, arrival date and the length of stay (number of nights). Define interfaces so that they are implemented by classes. In the main method create an instance of the hotel class and instances of rooms and customers and test that the application works in a meaningful way according to the requirements.
