Develop a Windows Form application in C#, which provides an interface for entering flight information (flight id, origin, destination, date and time). After entering all required data and submitting them, the application should display all recent and previous data on a summary page (a differenet windows form). Hint: You can prevent a form from being closed by defining FormClosing event handler for the form and adding this line to the method: e.Cancel=true;
