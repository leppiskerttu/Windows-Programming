Write an application in C# in which you define class Concert to manage concert information. Relevant attributes for class Concert are title, location, date, time and price. Define the default constructor as well as some other meaningful constructors and a method, which returns concert information as text. Define also the following operators for the class:
== and Equals operators so that two Concert objects can be compared to each other 
< operator so that a Concert object is smaller than the other one if it's price is smaller 
> operator so that a Concert object is greater than the other one if it's price is greater 
 ++ and -- operators so that they would increase or decrease the concert price by 5 units  
In the main method of the application, define an ArrayList and initialize it by five Concert objects. Use operators to put the Concert objects in ascending order based on their price values and print out their information to the standard output device. Use defined operators to make sure they work correctly.
